# MARIMBA

Welcome to the MARIBMA project repository for the Class of 2019 URI Ocean Engineering Senior Design Project - Section 4.

This is a continuation of the previous year's project started in Fall 2017 to fulfill Deepwater Wind's request to design a system for real time passive whale tracking near their offshore wind energy facilities.
